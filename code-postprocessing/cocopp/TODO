cocopp package random thoughts:
* web: unify, clean up (3 places right now)
* make it easier to work from the python command-line: operations such as generating single figures...
* documentation of LaTeX templates & overall structure: what is in each template?
     different outputs: have to work with a template
     1 alg:
     ppfigdim: scaling figures, show ERT for different target vs dim for one algorithm
     pptable: table of bootstrap distribution of ERT for numerous functions and different dimensions
     ppecdf: ec distribution of run lengths for reaching different targets and also ecdf of function values
     pplos: figure and table of ERT log loss for given budgets

     2 algs:
     ppfig2: ert ratios over target function values
     pptable2: ert for different target function values
     ppscatter: scatter plot ERT1 vs ERT0
     ppecdf2: superposition of ECD of run lengths for given target function values

     more algs:
     ppfigs: bootstrap distribution of ert over multiple targets
     pptables: bootstrap distribution ert over multiple targets

     data dependency graph:
	    targets -> ERT
		targets -> bootstrap distribution of ERT
		targets -> run lengths
		budget -> targets -> ERT


TODO:
* 300+ algorithms: provide individual performance tables on the web with (a) fixed targets and (b) run-length-based targets using 1e-8 as last additional target row
* Web server for the execution of the code (could be the experiments or the post-processing...)


Feature missing:
*Automatically generate the associated TeX file to compile...

Misc.
*Explicit demo post processing.
