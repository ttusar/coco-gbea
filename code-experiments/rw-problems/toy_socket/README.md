# Toy socket

Two suites of benchmark problems to showcase the socket evaluation within COCO. Both are implemented in C as well as in Python. See [this README.md](../README.md) for information on their usage.

## The single-objective `toy-socket` test suite

This suite contains one instance of two functions in two dimensions (2 and 30). The first function has two constraints and the second has none. 

## The bi-objective `toy-socket` test suite

This suite contains one instance of two functions in two dimensions (2 and 30). The functions are actually the same, but the function has no constraints, while the second has one.
